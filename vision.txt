Product Vision Document (Condensed v1.0 – December 29, 2025)
Name: SOAPBOX
Tagline: The Intelligence Operating System
Core Thesis
Most intelligence platforms are either bloated enterprise portals or fragmented news aggregators. SOAPBOX is a minimalist, real-time desktop environment that turns the browser into a personal command center for understanding complex, multidimensional reality—geopolitics, technology, markets, narratives—through structured AI reasoning, visual composability, and user-controlled depth.
Guiding Principles

Minimalism by default, infinite configurability on demand
Composable windows > monolithic pages
All advanced controls hidden behind drawers, modals, or hotkeys
Subtle calibration: pro-Western, pro-meritocracy, pro-human flourishing (never overt)
WCAG 2.2 AA compliance from day one
Backward-compatible schema evolution (optional fields only)
Freemium: generous free tier, paid unlocks depth and aesthetics

Target User
Independent analysts, policy researchers, investors, technologists, and curious citizens who want Signal without the noise, Maltego without the complexity, and Bloomberg without the price tag.
Differentiators

OS-like draggable workspace with per-workspace persistence
Temporal layers (historical → current → predictive) in one feed
Propaganda/narrative tracking with credibility scoring
Entity relationship force graphs with sentiment deltas
Multi-domain expansion (geopolitics → AI/semi → energy/climate → biotech)
Hotkey-driven power user workflow with cheatsheet
