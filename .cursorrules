# SOAPBOX Development Guardrails & Cursor Rules

Goal: Prevent future drift from the project's minimalist, composable philosophy.

## Core Philosophy
- **Composability over Hardcoding**: Always prioritize building small, reusable, and composable components/functions over single-purpose, hardcoded features.
- **Clean Interfaces**: Hide advanced options and complexity behind clean, intuitive interfaces (e.g., drawers, modals, or collapsed sections).
- **Minimalist UI**: Never add visible tag filtering or complex controls directly to the main view without a containment strategy (like a drawer).
- **User Choice**: Favor user-defined configurations and settings over rigid defaults.

## Technical Guardrails
- **Backward Compatibility**: All schema changes must be implemented as optional fields to ensure backward compatibility and prevent breaking changes.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Before adding a new library, evaluate if the functionality can be implemented simply using existing tools.

## Project Management
- **Plane MCP Integration**: Use Plane to align tasks with the project roadmap:
  - When starting a task, check Plane for a corresponding issue.
  - Upon completion, mark the relevant issue as "Done".
  - Avoid redundant comments in Plane; Git history serves as the primary technical record.
